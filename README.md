# Currency Conversion API

Welcome to the Currency Conversion API, an efficient, reliable solution designed to facilitate real-time currency exchange rates and conversion operations for developers, financial analysts, and businesses worldwide. This API provides a robust platform for integrating currency conversion functionalities into your applications, offering up-to-date exchange rates, user-specific transaction tracking, and extensive documentation to ensure seamless implementation.

## Features

### Real-Time Currency Conversion
Convert amounts between a wide range of global currencies with real-time exchange rates.

### Transaction Tracking
Each conversion operation is saved as a transaction, allowing users to track their currency exchange history.

### Embedded SQLite Database
Leveraging an embedded SQLite database, this database integration facilitates swift data retrieval and transaction storage without the complexities of external database management.


### Rate Limiting
To ensure uninterrupted service and avoid potential downtimes due to excessive requests, our API implements rate limiting. This crucial feature prevents abuse and guarantees the API's availability and performance, even under high traffic conditions.

### Scalable
Whether you're a startup or a large enterprise, our API is built to scale with your needs, handling requests efficiently regardless of volume.

### Automatic Deployment via Heroku
To automate deployments to Heroku and ensure your application is always up to date with the latest commits in your GitHub repository, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Steps for Setup:
Heroku CLI and GitHub Secrets:

## Ensure the Heroku CLI is installed and you are logged in.
